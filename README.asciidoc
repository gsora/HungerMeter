Hunger Meter
============

About application
-----------------

Simple monitor showing current battery consumption. Visible in cover action as
well, so you can peek to see how battery hungry is your phone at it's current
state even from running applications (that affect consumption).

It displays two values - current consumption which is by default last 1s and
average which is average for last 10s. You can configure these time intervals
via _Settings_ menu as well as sampling interval.

Hunger meter can help you decide whether changes you did to your device setup
are going to help you get better battery life or not (for example which
applications doesn't hurt keep running on background and which does).

more useful HelloWord, but it evolved into something useful as well :-)
