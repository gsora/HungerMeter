Hunger Meter
============

About application
-----------------

Simple monitor showing current battery consumption. Visible in cover action as
well, so you can peek to see how battery hungry is your phone at it's current
state even from running applications (that affect consumption).

It displays two values - current consumption which is last 1s and average which
is average for last 10s. Via pull down/push up menus you can configure
different intervals. Settings are not saved so they affect application only
till it is shut down.

Hunger meter is so far really simple - not much more than HelloWorld, but it
can be already useful to help you decide whether changes you did to your
device setup are going to help you get better battery life or not (for example
which applications doesn't hurt keep running on background and which does).

About the origin
----------------

This application was written by http://michal.hrusecky.net[Michal Hrušecký] as
an attempt to play with QML and Sailfish. It's initial purpose is better and
more useful HelloWord, but it evolved into something useful as well :-)
